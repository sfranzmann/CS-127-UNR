# CS-127-UNR
These are the two largest projects I completed while attending UNR.
These projects are all done in C using only stdio and string (the course did not allow any other libraries)

The Students.c project was desinged to test out knowledge of FILE IO and pointers.
This project required us to create a program that could pull certain data points from a text document (student number, gpa, and credits) and display them to the user.
The program was also capable of editing the text document itself and finding the average, min, and max of the GPAs listed in the document.


The connect4.c project is a version of the game connect four that I built in C.
The project utilizes many important elements of C including the use of pointers, 1d and 2d arrays, and FILE io
This project also demonstrates my ability to solve complex issues such determining if there are four of the same character in the same column, row, or diagonal.
This is the most rigorous project (interms of lines of code and difficulty) I have completed as of 9/9/2020
